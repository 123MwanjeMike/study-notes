# Text processing

## Capturing data

Data can be obtained from several sources. To be able to process, first the origin and format should be known: 
	- E.g. comes from a HTTP request, comes in json/xml
	- Comes from a textfile separated by the newline (\n) character

## Cleaning data

Data should be clean according to the type of analysis that is needed. For example, `BeautifulSoup` is a python library that can be used to parse HTML content to find specific regions.
