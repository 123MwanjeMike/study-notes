## Bag of words

This technique converts each document to a corresponding unordered collection of words (bag). One of the applications, could be checking multiple documents for plagiarism or sentiment analysis from a collection of tweets.

Vectorization of a set of documents can be accomplished to have a better reading than analyzing each separate document. In this approach, a corpus would be constructed from all the documents and a frequency table should be composed having a column for each pre-processed token. This can be known as a **Document-Term Matrix**.
