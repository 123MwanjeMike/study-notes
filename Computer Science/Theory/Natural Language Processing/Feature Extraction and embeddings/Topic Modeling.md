- Should take into account a successful stemming and text processing to leave only relevant words for a document. 
	- For formula purposes, the document is denoted by $d$, the terms or words by $t$, and the probability of a word given a document is $P(t|d)$ which could be identified in the following manner: 
$$
P(t|d) = \frac{C(t)}{C(}
$$
