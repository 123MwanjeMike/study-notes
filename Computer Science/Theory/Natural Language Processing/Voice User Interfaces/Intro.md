# Voice User Interfaces

Voice-enabled agents are common in phones, computers, cars. 
End-to-end usual pipeline:
- Audio waves are converted into language texts using ML algorithms and probabilistic models
- The resulting text is reasoned using AI logic to determine the meaning and formulate a response
- The response text must be converted back into understandable speech with ML tools

## Pipeline
- Voice to text (Speech Recognition)
	- Sound vibrations are converted to an audio signal
	- The signal is sample in some way and the samples can be converted into vectors of component frequencies **(Spectogram)**
		- The vectors represent features of sound in a data set (Feature ex
