# Speech Recognition

**ASR**. Automatic Speech Recognition. Has as goal to input any continuous audio speech and output the text equivalent.
**Sound signal** the data used in ASR.
- Models can be divided in 
	- Acoustic Model. Solves the problem of turning sound signals into some kind of phonetic representation.
	- Language Model. Houses the domain knowledge of words, grammar and sentence structure for the language.

**Challenges in ASR**
- Variability
	- Pitch 
	- Volume
	- Speed
- Ambiguity
	- Word boundaries
	- Spelling
	- Context

# Signal Analysis

- Speech can be thought to be created by sinusoidal waves in air. Higher pitches vibrate faster with a higher frequency than lower pitches.
- Acoustical energy carried in a sound wave can be transduced to electrical energy to be recorded as an audio signal
	- The amplitude of signal tells how loud or how much acoustical energy is in a specific region.
