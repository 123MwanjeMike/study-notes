# Recurrent Neural Neworks

This type of neural networks rely on a memory element (past inputs being fed again into the neural network along with new inputs). This type of neural networks works for applications with temporal dependencies.

## Feedforward Neural Networks

This kind of neural networks don't have the ability to capture dependencies that change over time.

- An enhancement proposed were Time Delay Neural Networks (TDNN) which had a window of time represented by a set of inputs into the Neura
