## NLP Pipeline

A basic processing pipeline for natural language could be identified as having the following stages:
- Text processing. Takes raw input text, cleans it, normalizes it.
- Feature extraction. Generates feature representations appropriate for the desired model.
- Modeling. NLP task.

### Text processing

Text processing is needed because information is gathered from multiple sources where text might be entangled with different markups, formats or constructs that are information only valid to the type of source from where the text is extracted.

### Feature Extraction

Computers don't hold standard representations of words.
