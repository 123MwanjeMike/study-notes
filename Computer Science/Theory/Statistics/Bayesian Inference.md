# Bayesian Inference

## Definitions
- Every event has a set of outcomes that identify (Favourable outcomes).
	- Notation indicates sets are written in upper case and elements in lower case.
- Set can be empty, thus being named empty set or null set: Ã˜.

## Sets

Sets can be finite or infinite. To denote an element belongs to a set we describe it as: 
$$x \in A | x \notin A$$
To denote contention:
$$A \ni x | A \notni x$$

- The inverted A can be used to make a reference about all elements within a set; is known as `for all`.
