# Bayesian Inference

## Definitions
- Every event has a set of outcomes that identify (Favourable outcomes).
	- Notation indicates sets are written in upper case and elements in lower case.
- Set can be empty, thus being named empty set or null set: Ø.

## Sets

Sets can be finite or infinite. To denote an element belongs to a set we describe it as: 
$$x \in A | x \notin A$$
To denote contention:
$$A \ni x | A \notni x$$

- The inverted A can be used to make a reference about all elements within a set; is known as `for all`.
$$\forall$$
- To make statements about a specific group of elements within a set, `:` is used and described as `such that`.

Example, declaring a set of all even numbers

$$\forall x \in A : x\;is\;even$$

- A **subset** is a set that is fully contained in another set. This is described as: 
$$A \subseteq B$$

- Every set contains necessarily two subsets; itself and the null set. 
$$A \subseteq A \\
A \subseteq Ø$$
