# Bayes Theorem

Also known as Bayes' Rule or Bayes' Probability. 

Given conditional probability and the multiplication rule we have the following system of equations: 

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \\
P(A \cap B) = P(B|A) * P(A)
$$
We can conclude the following equation:
$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) * P(A)}{P(B)}
$$
This allows us to find a relationship between the different conditional probabilities of two events.
