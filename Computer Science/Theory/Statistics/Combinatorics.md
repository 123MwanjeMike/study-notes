# Combinatorics

Deals with combinations of objects from a specific finite set. It can contain repetition, order or other restrictions.

## Permutations

Number of different possible ways we can arrange a set of elements.

Given a set with `n` values defining an ordered list or configurations of these values would render this possible entries for each position: 

$$
n, n-1, n-2, n-3, ..., 1 \\
P_n = n * (n -1 ) * (n-2)*...*1 = n!
$$
