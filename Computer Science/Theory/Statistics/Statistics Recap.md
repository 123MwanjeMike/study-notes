# Statistics

## Probability

- Event. The outcome of a given event or more than one event that is likely or unlikely to happen.
- Probability of an event A. This is equal to the number of preferred (favourable) outcomes over the number of all possible (sample space) outcomes.

Probability of getting head while tossing a coin
$$P(A) = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5$$

Probability of getting an specific number while rolling a dice
$$P(A) = \frac{1}{6} \approx 0.167$$

- Probability of independent events. Probability of first event times the probability of 
$$P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$$
