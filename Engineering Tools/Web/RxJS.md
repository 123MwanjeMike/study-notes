# RxJS

Reactive programming in javascript.

Comparison: 
- Procedural. Programs are collection of functions and execution goes from top to bottom executing sequentially. 
	- Easy to write code, but hard to maintain, relies on a global state and is prone to difficult bugs.
- Object Oriented. Based on the concept of an object, a collection of state and behavior. 
	- State and behavior is localized, but can be more verbose and code is still imperative.
- Declarative
- Functional
- Reactive
