# Reliable Cloud Infrastructure

## Steps

### 1. Defining a case study
- Add a brief description
- List a few main features
- List roles of typical users

### 2. Requirements, analysis and design

**Requirements analysis**
| Who | Determining not only the user of the system, but developers and stake holders. Who the systems affects directly and indirectly  | Who are the user? Who are the developers? Who are the stakeholders? |
|--|--|--|
| What | Establish the main areas of functionality required in a clear unambiguous manner | What does the system do? What are the main features?|
| Why | What is a problem the proposed system aims to address or solve? Without a clear understanding extra requirements will certainly be added. This will potentially help in defining KPIs, SLOs and SLAs | Why is the system needed? |
| When | Helps determine a realistic timeline and can help contain the scope | When do the users need and/or want the solution? When can the developers be done? |
| How | Helps determine non-functional requirements | How will the system work? How many users will there be? How much data will there be?  |

**Roles**
- Represet the goal of a user
- Are not people or job titles
	- People and roles have a many to many relationship
	- Should describe a users objective. What does the user want to do?
- For more important roles a **Persona** can be created
	- Is an imaginary representation of a user role
	- Personas tell a story of who they are
	- Describe a feature from the user's point of view
		- Give each story a title that describes its purpose
		- Write a short, one sentence description
		- Specify the user role, what they want to do, and why
		- Use the template: As a [role], I want to..., so that I can....
			- Alternative: Given...[context], When I do...., then .... 
		- Ex. **As an** account holder, **I want to** check my available balance at any time of day **so** I am sure not to overdraw my account
