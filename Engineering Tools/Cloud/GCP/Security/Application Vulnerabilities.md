# Application Vulnerabilities

- Injection. Happens when some form of malicious content can be injected into an application from an app attacker and then the application accepts and interprets the content.
	- SQL
	- LDAP
	- HTML
- **Cross-site scripting**. A form of injection where the attacker is able to inject javascript into an application, and the code injection originates from a different site. Used to hijack user sessions, deface user websites and redirect the user to other malicious sites.
- **Weak authentication and access control**. Authentication, access control and session management are application logic functions which are often implemented insecurely. This can allow attackers to compromise passwords, keys or session tokens to exploit flaws and assume the users' identities.
