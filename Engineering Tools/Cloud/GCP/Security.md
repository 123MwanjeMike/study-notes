# Security


## Connection to Virtual Machines

- Linux instances accessed via Secure Shell 
	- Require a username and an SSH key
	- Password authentication is disabled by default
	- GCP console provides built-in SSH access
		- Connects through HTTPS and shares SSH keys to initiate an SSH session
		- Needs public IP address and a firewall rule for incoming TCP traffic in port 22
		- GCloud SDK can also be used `gcloud compute ssh web-server --zone us-central1-c`
			- This process automatically locates .ssh keys in ~/.ssh
- Window instances accessed via Remote Desktop Protocol
	- Require username and password
- Connecting from outside Google Console
	- Is possible with a username and valid SSH key
		- Key needs to be provided to the instance using the project's metadata `SSH Keys` tab
- VMs can be configured to not use project-wide SSH keys `Block project-wide SSH keys`
- Keys can also be added to instance-specific metadata
- **If no public address**
	- Bastion host
		- Create a second VM with public IP in the same network
		- Connect to Bastion host
		- SSH into private VM
