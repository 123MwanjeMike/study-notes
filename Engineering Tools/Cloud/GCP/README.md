## Deployment: Infrastructure as a Code

It's better to define templates for infrastructure to follow a declarative strategy instead of an imperative (introducing each command per each desired action)

GCP uses **Deployment Manager** (Infrastructure management service) to let users work in this way. Works with a YAML template file or a python file.

## Proactive monitoring

Monitoring lets you figure out whether the changes you made were good or bad.
It lets you respond with information rather than with panic. GCP works with Stackdriver for monitoring, logging and diagnostics.
