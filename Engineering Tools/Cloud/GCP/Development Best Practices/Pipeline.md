# Development Best Practices

## Managing code and environment 
- Inside Code repository
	- Don't store dependencies, rather use dependencies managers
	- Don't store configuration settings as part of code, instead configure them as environment variables
	- Instead of monolithic architectures consider implementing microservices architectures.
