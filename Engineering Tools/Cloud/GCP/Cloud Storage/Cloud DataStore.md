# Best Practices

- Data objects are called entities
	- Comprise one or more properties
- Each entity has a unique key that contains
	- Namespace
	- Entity Kind
	- Identifier (string or numeric ID)
	- Ancestor path
		- The path from root entity to child entity
- Operations on one or more entities are called transactions and are atomic
- Entity can have parent
	- Without a parent is a root entity
