# Google Kubernetes Engine

Orchestration platform to manage containers in clusters.

GKE stands in between Compute Engine as a IaaS and App Engine as a PaaS. 

GKE works around containers which give you the abstraction needed to run and scale your application without worrying on resource deployment, and the flexibility of IaaS solutions to manage the interrelations between the processes being run. 

Containers are alike to virtual machines but save the time and resources needed from booting up high-cost operating systems, to have a more process-like starting experience.

Kubernetes makes it easy to orchestrate many containers on many hosts. It helps to scale them, roll out new versions of them, and even roll back to the old version if things go wrong.

For building container images there are two options
- Docker
- Google Cloud Build
