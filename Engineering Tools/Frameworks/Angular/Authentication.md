# Authentication and Security

> Notes taken from udemy's course AngularJS Authentication: Secure your app with AuthO from Ryan Chenkie

- RESTful APIs may conflict with traditional authentication behaviour, setting sessions to store authorization cookies in client's side.
- In cookie-based authentication, sessions can't be easily shared.
- Cookies set a drawback in authentication when it comes to implementing the same API in multiple clients. As the data storage strategy needs to be defined for each different client's environment.
